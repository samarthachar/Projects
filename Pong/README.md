This project is a digital recreation of the classic arcade game Pong, built using Python’s Turtle graphics module. It features two-player paddle action where each player controls a paddle positioned on either side of the screen, attempting to keep a fast-moving ball in play. The objective is to score points by bouncing the ball past the opponent’s paddle while avoiding missed shots on your own side.

At launch, the game presents a sleek black screen with two paddles—one on the left, one on the right—and a ball placed in the center. The right paddle is controlled using the “Up” and “Down” arrow keys, while the left paddle responds to the “W” and “S” keys. The ball moves diagonally across the screen, bouncing off the top and bottom walls. If it hits a paddle, it ricochets in the opposite direction. If it passes a paddle without making contact, the opposing player earns a point, and the ball resets to the center.

The game uses modular Python files such as `paddle.py`, `ball.py`, and `scoreboard.py` to manage movement logic, collision detection, scoring, and speed control. The scoreboard tracks points in real time and updates with each successful play. The ball’s speed dynamically adjusts to create a sense of challenge, and the game runs smoothly with frame updates controlled by a timed loop.

No external libraries are required to run this game—everything is handled through Python’s built-in modules. It’s a fantastic project for anyone learning object-oriented programming, basic physics simulations, and graphical design through Turtle. Whether played competitively or solo for fun, this Python Pong clone delivers retro joy with modern structure and simplicity.
