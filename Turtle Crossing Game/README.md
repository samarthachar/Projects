This project is a simple arcade-style crossing game built with Python’s Turtle graphics library. The player takes control of a small character positioned at the bottom of the screen, tasked with navigating safely across a highway while avoiding fast-moving cars. Each time the player reaches the top of the screen, they level up, and the game grows more challenging with faster vehicles and more frequent traffic.

The game begins on a square playing field with a 600x600 pixel canvas. The player uses the “Up” arrow key to move forward, attempting to dodge the stream of vehicles that appear randomly and zoom from right to left. Cars are generated at timed intervals, creating a sense of unpredictability as the player progresses. Collision detection is in place so that any crash with a car immediately ends the game, triggering a “Game Over” message on the screen.

The game includes clean modular components: `player.py` handles movement and positioning; `car_manager.py` controls vehicle creation, motion, and speed scaling; and `scoreboard.py` tracks progress across levels and displays messages. As the player successfully reaches the finish line, their position resets to the start and the speed of incoming cars increases—creating a dynamic challenge as the game continues.

This terminal-based game uses only Python’s standard libraries and is an excellent hands-on project to explore object-oriented programming, randomization, collision logic, and screen drawing with Turtle. With its simple controls, escalating difficulty, and modular structure, it captures the spirit of classic games like Frogger in an accessible, code-friendly form.
