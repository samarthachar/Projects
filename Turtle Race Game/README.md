This project is a lively console-based **Turtle Race Game** built using Python’s `turtle` module. The game sets up a race track where seven turtle-shaped characters, each assigned a vibrant color from the rainbow, line up at the starting line and dash toward the finish in randomized bursts. Before the race begins, the player places a bet by selecting one of the turtles based on color. The tension builds as the race unfolds step by step, with each turtle inching forward at unpredictable speeds until one crosses the finish line first.

At its core, the game utilizes basic object creation and event handling to deliver an engaging and visually entertaining experience. Turtle objects are initialized and spaced evenly on the left side of the screen, each one ready to sprint forward. The game prompts the user to input a color guess via a text dialog box — this acts as their chosen racer. Once the race starts, each turtle moves forward by a random distance between 0 and 10 units per iteration, simulating a dynamic and fair race.

The race loop continues until any one turtle reaches the x-coordinate threshold of 230, which marks the finish line. At that point, the game checks the winning turtle’s color and compares it to the player’s bet. The outcome is declared via a simple print message, informing the user whether their bet paid off or not. This project is a great hands-on exploration of loops, randomness, screen setup, and graphical event flow — perfect for Python beginners who want to mix fun with foundational learning. The modular setup and clean logic also make it easy to expand with features like lap tracking, countdown timers, or animations.
