This project is a console-based quiz game written in Python where the player is challenged to guess who has more followers between two randomly selected public figures, brands, or organizations. The game pulls data from a separate file called `game_data.py`, which contains a list of entities, each with a name, a short description, a country of origin, and their number of social media followers. The game presents two of these entries side by side and asks the player to choose which one they think has a higher follower count.

At the start of the game, two random entries are selected. If the same entry is selected twice, the game ensures that they are different by reselecting one of them. The player is shown the name, description, and country of origin for each option — labeled "A" and "B" — and is then asked to guess which one has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'. If the guess is correct, the player's score increases by one, and the second option ("B") becomes the new "A" for the next round. A new "B" is then randomly selected, and the player is asked to guess again. This continues until the player makes an incorrect guess, at which point the game ends and the final score is displayed.

The game includes simple control logic to handle user input, compare follower counts, and prevent crashes in case of unexpected input. It also uses ASCII art stored in an `art.py` file to enhance the visual presentation. The game clears the screen between rounds (simulated by printing many newlines) to keep the interface clean. This project offers a fun, interactive way to test your intuition about online popularity, and it’s a great example of how to use random selection, loops, and basic data structures in Python.
