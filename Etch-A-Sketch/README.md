This project is a Python recreation of the classic **Etch-A-Sketch** toy, utilizing the `turtle` graphics module to simulate freeform drawing based on user-controlled input. The game sets up a turtle object that starts facing upward and responds to specific key presses to move forward, backward, or rotate left and right. Players can guide the turtle to “draw” on the screen much like twisting the knobs of an actual Etch-A-Sketch. The program runs entirely in the console window and uses the turtle canvas to visualize movements.

At launch, a turtle object is initialized along with a listening screen that captures keyboard input. The keys `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` serve as motion controls: `W` moves the turtle forward, `S` moves it backward, `A` turns it left, and `D` turns it right. Each motion causes the turtle to draw lines as it moves, mimicking the line-drawing behavior of an Etch-A-Sketch. Users can also press `C` to clear the screen and reset the turtle’s heading back to its original upward direction. This allows players to start fresh and sketch new designs multiple times within the same session.

The program uses event listeners via `screen.onkey()` to respond instantly to key presses, making it an engaging introduction to real-time user interaction and graphical feedback in Python. It’s ideal for beginners who want to explore the `turtle` module and get hands-on experience with movement, drawing commands, and simple input handling. With a few lines of code, players can create zigzags, patterns, or even rudimentary shapes, all while learning foundational programming concepts like functions, keyboard events, and screen updates. It’s a fun fusion of nostalgia and code, offering creative freedom through the keyboard and turtle canvas.
