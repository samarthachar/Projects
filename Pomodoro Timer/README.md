This project is a simple desktop Pomodoro timer built using Python's `tkinter` library. Inspired by the time-management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo, it helps users break work into intervals—typically 25 minutes of focused work followed by short breaks—to boost productivity. The program features a cheerful tomato-themed interface, enhanced by visual elements like a `tomato.png` image and a ticking timer display. All the UI elements, including buttons and labels, are styled in soft pastel colors to keep the environment calm and pleasant.

When the application starts, the user is greeted with a clean interface and a “Start” button. Once clicked, the timer kicks off a 25-minute work session. After each session, the timer automatically transitions into a short break (5 minutes), and after every four work sessions, a longer 20-minute break is triggered. These intervals are managed using a repetition counter (`reps`) and a countdown mechanism that updates the timer display every second. A check mark is shown after each completed work session as a gentle form of progress tracking.

The structure of the code is thoughtfully modular, with separate functions for starting, resetting, and counting down the timer. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as function callbacks, conditional logic, global state management, and UI customization. Since it uses only built-in libraries, it's entirely self-contained and beginner-friendly, making it a great introductory project for understanding both the Pomodoro technique and Python’s GUI capabilities.
