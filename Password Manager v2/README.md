This upgraded version of the Password Manager builds on its predecessor by adding new functionality and improving data handling. Still using Python’s `tkinter` for its graphical interface, this version introduces a more advanced password storage system using JSON format, enabling users to efficiently save and retrieve login credentials in a structured way. The interface retains its clean, beginner-friendly layout, with familiar entry fields for website, email, and password, alongside buttons for generating, saving, and now also searching for stored passwords.

Users can generate secure passwords with one click, thanks to the built-in randomizer that selects letters, numbers, and symbols in varying counts and shuffles them for maximum security. These passwords are copied directly to the clipboard and inserted into the password field for convenience. When saving credentials, the application validates inputs and prompts for confirmation before updating the `data.json` file. The system gracefully handles cases where the file doesn't yet exist or contains invalid data, ensuring robustness and preventing crashes.

A standout addition in this version is the “Search” button, which lets users quickly look up previously saved passwords by entering the website name. The app searches the JSON file and, if a match is found, displays the associated email and password. If the website isn't found or the data file is missing, clear messages are shown to inform the user without disrupting the experience.

This upgraded Password Manager is a great project for learning how to build more functional and reliable desktop applications. It teaches data validation, exception handling, JSON manipulation, and how to craft user-friendly interfaces while maintaining a focus on security and usability.
