# üìù Flask Blog ‚Äî Version 2

This project is a full-featured blogging platform built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF, and CKEditor, offering complete CRUD functionality for managing blog posts. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete articles through a clean, Bootstrap-powered interface, while storing all post data in a local SQLite database. **This version (v2)** builds on the earlier static blog by introducing dynamic content management and rich text editing, making it a practical and scalable solution for personal or portfolio blogging.

When users visit the homepage, they‚Äôre greeted with a visually appealing layout featuring a banner image and a list of blog post previews. Each post displays its title, subtitle, author, and publication date, and links to a dedicated page showing the full content. Posts are stored in a database table defined by the `BlogPost` model, which includes fields for title, subtitle, date, body, author, and image URL. The body content is handled using CKEditor, allowing users to format their text with headings, lists, links, and more.

Users can add new posts by clicking the ‚ÄúCreate New Post‚Äù button, which opens a form built with Flask-WTF. The form includes fields for all post attributes and uses validators to ensure that required data is entered correctly. Upon submission, the post is saved to the database and displayed on the homepage. Editing a post is just as seamless‚Äîusers can update any field, including the rich text body, and changes are saved instantly. Posts can also be deleted with a single click, removing them from the database and the interface.

This project is an excellent example of how to build a dynamic content management system using Flask. It demonstrates key concepts such as form validation, database modeling, template rendering, and integration with third-party tools like CKEditor. With its intuitive design and robust functionality, it‚Äôs a powerful starting point for anyone looking to create a personal blog or learn full-stack web development in Python.
