This project is a dynamic movie ranking web application built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF, and Bootstrap. It allows users to curate a personalized list of their top 10 favorite movies, complete with ratings, reviews, and poster images. The app integrates with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie details automatically, making the experience both interactive and visually rich. All data is stored in a local SQLite database, and the interface is styled with Bootstrap for a clean, responsive layout.

When users visit the homepage, they’re greeted with a grid of movie cards, each displaying the film’s poster, title, release year, rating, review, and a ranking based on its score. The ranking is dynamically calculated by sorting all movies in descending order of their rating. Each card includes buttons to update the review or delete the movie from the list. If the user wants to add a new movie, they can click the “Add Movie” button, which leads to a form where they enter the movie title. Upon submission, the app queries the TMDb API and presents a selection of matching results. Once the user chooses a movie, its details are fetched and stored in the database, and they’re redirected to a form to rate and review it.

The backend uses SQLAlchemy’s declarative base to define the `Movie` model, which includes fields for title, year, description, rating, ranking, review, and image URL. Flask-WTF handles form validation for both adding and editing movies, ensuring that user input is clean and consistent. The use of WTForms makes it easy to manage form fields and apply constraints like maximum length and required values.

This project is an excellent example of full-stack development with Flask. It demonstrates how to combine API integration, database management, form handling, and responsive design into a cohesive user experience. With its polished interface and practical functionality, it’s a great showcase for anyone learning how to build modern web apps in Python.
