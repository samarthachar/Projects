This project is a simple, text-based Blackjack game created using Python. It allows one player to play against a computer-controlled dealer, following basic Blackjack rules. The game simulates a deck of cards where face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points, number cards keep their face value, and Aces can count as either 11 or 1 depending on which value keeps the hand under or at 21.

When the game begins, both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards. One of the dealer’s cards is shown to the player, while the other is hidden. The player can then choose to “hit” to draw another card or “stand” to end their turn. If the player's total goes over 21, they lose immediately. If not, the dealer takes their turn, drawing cards until their total is at least 17. Once both turns are complete, the game compares the final scores and determines a winner, with logic for busts, draws, and Blackjacks.

The game includes extra features such as automatic detection of Blackjacks (a combination of an Ace and a 10-value card), handling of multiple Aces correctly, and fun printed messages to describe the outcomes (like wins, losses, and draws). There’s also ASCII art displayed at the start of each round, which is stored in a separate `art.py` file. After each game, the player is asked whether they want to play again, allowing for repeated play without restarting the program.

This game runs entirely in the terminal and does not require any external libraries beyond Python's built-in modules. It's designed to be lightweight and entertaining, making it a great beginner project or a quick way to enjoy a few rounds of Blackjack from the command line.
