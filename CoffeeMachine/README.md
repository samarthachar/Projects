This project is a simple simulation of a coffee machine built with Python that allows users to order different types of coffee drinks â€” espresso, latte, or cappuccino. The machine manages resources such as water, milk, coffee, and money, and checks whether there are enough ingredients available to prepare the selected drink. Each beverage has a defined recipe and cost, stored in a structured menu dictionary. The program ensures resource availability before proceeding with the order, and it also includes coin processing to simulate payment.

When a user enters a coffee order, the program first checks if the drink exists in the menu and whether the required ingredients are available. If not, it notifies the user of the missing resource. If everything is in place, the machine prompts the user to input the number of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) they are inserting. It then calculates the total amount of money provided. If the amount is insufficient, it notifies the user and refunds the money. If the payment is adequate, the machine deducts the used ingredients from its available resources, updates the total money earned, and confirms the order by providing change and a friendly message.

Additionally, the coffee machine includes commands such as `"report"` to display the current status of resources, and `"off"` to power down the machine. The structure of the program demonstrates core programming skills such as working with dictionaries, handling user input, performing calculations, using loops and conditionals, and organizing logic into functions. This project is a great exercise in simulating real-world systems and provides a practical example of how to manage state, resources, and user interaction in a Python script.
