This is a simple command-line Caesar Cipher tool written in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted forward or backward in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. This program allows users to both encrypt (encode) and decrypt (decode) messages by specifying the shift amount and direction. It provides a playful way to explore classical encryption methods and basic string manipulation in Python.

When the script is run, an ASCII art logo is displayed (stored in a separate art.py file), and the user is prompted to choose whether they want to encode or decode a message. They are then asked to enter the message itself and the numerical shift value. The program processes the input by shifting each letter accordingly. Non-alphabet characters, such as punctuation and spaces, are preserved and included unchanged in the output. The result is printed back to the user with a message indicating whether it was encoded or decoded.

The core logic is handled by a single function called caesar, which performs the shift and handles wrap-around at the end of the alphabet. For decoding, the function simply reverses the direction of the shift. After each operation, the user is asked if they want to perform another encryption or decryption. If they choose "yes," the process repeats; if they choose "no," the program prints a goodbye message and ends.

This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates key programming concepts like loops, conditionals, string manipulation, modular arithmetic, and user input handling. Itâ€™s also a fun and interactive way to learn about historical ciphers and simple cryptographic ideas.
