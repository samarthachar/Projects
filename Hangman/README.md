This project is a Python-based version of the classic word-guessing game **Hangman**, designed to run in the console. The game selects a random word from a predefined list of possible words stored in an external `hangman_words.py` file. The player’s objective is to guess the hidden word one letter at a time before running out of lives. Each incorrect guess reduces the player's available lives, and the game ends when the player either successfully guesses the entire word or uses up all their lives.

At the start of the game, an ASCII art logo from the `hangman_art.py` file is displayed, adding a fun visual element. The game then selects a random word and displays it as a series of underscores to represent each unguessed letter. On each turn, the player is prompted to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed. If the letter has already been guessed, the player is informed without penalty. If the guess is incorrect, the player loses a life, and a corresponding part of the hangman graphic is revealed using ASCII art from the `hangman_art.py` file.

The player is kept informed of their remaining lives and current progress on the word after each guess. If the player runs out of lives, the game ends and reveals the correct word. If they manage to guess all the letters before losing all their lives, they win. The script uses loops, conditional logic, list handling, and string manipulation to manage game flow, making it a great beginner project for understanding these foundational programming concepts.

This Hangman game is interactive, visually engaging (thanks to ASCII art), and structured in a modular way with external files for better organization. It’s ideal for learning about user input, game loops, and basic error checking while building a fun and familiar game.
