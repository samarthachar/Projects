This project is a graphical Password Manager application created using Python’s `tkinter` library. It offers users a streamlined way to generate, store, and manage secure passwords for their online accounts, all within a friendly and accessible interface. The program features a simple GUI layout with clearly labeled input fields for websites, email addresses, and passwords, as well as interactive buttons that handle password generation and data saving. A logo image is also displayed at the top to give the application a more polished visual touch.

When launched, the user is prompted to enter the name of a website, their email or username, and either manually input a password or click the "Generate Password" button to automatically produce a secure, randomized one. The generator combines a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, using Python’s `random` module to ensure unpredictability. Once generated, the password is copied directly to the clipboard for easy use and also inserted into the input field. If the user chooses to save their credentials, a confirmation dialog appears to double-check their intent. Approved entries are then appended to a text file (`passwords.txt`) in a structured format for future reference.

This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as input validation, GUI event handling, file I/O operations, and clipboard management through the `pyperclip` library. It’s a great hands-on project for beginners interested in building useful desktop tools and learning how to combine security principles with interface design. Simple, practical, and elegant—it’s a great introduction to real-world app development in Python.
